# Classification Project MVP

I made an initial logistic regression model with 2 variables: total pages views and average duration. The model score was 0.96. 


| | Negative | Postive |
|-| :-------:|:-------:| 
Negative | 3507 | 14 |
Positive | 120 | 10 |  
  
Above is the confusion matrix for the current model. The model is not accurately predicting the postive class. For ym next steps, I am hoping to implement measures to help with the imbalance of the dataset.
